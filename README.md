This is my first blog created from scratch. The blog is my first project since I finished CS50x. I'm using the Django framework and Python.

Note:
This is day 3 of the project, my initial commit was not being tracked due to some way that I set up my VScode. After learning how to do all git commands from my terminal, I should now have this running a bit smoother on the Github side of the project.
