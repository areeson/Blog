This is my first Django web based application, a person blog for two purposes.

1:
To show the more analytical side of me, shown through Reeson Tech. This is a blog for coding and professional work specifically.

2:
To show the creative side of me, shown through Reeson Studio. This blog will be used more for photography, traveling, personal stories, or anything else I feel that fits.

Together you're looking at a representation of both my "left-brain" analytical side, as well as my "right-brain" creative side.

Welcome.
